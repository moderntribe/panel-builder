## Permissions

There are various permissions capabilities available for you to enable/disable. 
To use them you would filter `panels_js_config`, maybe in your Initializer class in the core plugin or from permissions classes.
Example:

```php
	public function hook() {
		add_filter( 'panels_js_config', [ $this, 'modify_js_config' ] );
	}
	
	public function modify_js_config( $data = [] ) {
        global $current_user;
        $is_customer = SOME_CHECK_ON_ROLE_IN_USER;
        $data[ 'permissions' ] = [
            'can_sort_panels'         => ! $is_customer,
            'can_add_panels'          => ! $is_customer,
            'can_delete_panels'       => ! $is_customer,
        ];
        return $data;
    }
```
